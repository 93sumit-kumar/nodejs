# __What is Node JS ?__

#### Node.js is a javaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 javaScript engine.

#### Node.js is a javaScript running on the server.

# __History of Nodejs__

#### In 2009 an idea came in the mind of Ryan Dahl(Google Engineer) that why not run javaScript outside browser, so he took V8 engine and embedded in a c++ program and called it Node.exe later on become __NodeJS__

# __When to use Nodejs?__

* I/O bound
* Data Streaming Application
* Real time chat Application

# __WHEN SHOULD YOU NOT CONSIDER USING NODE.JS?__

* A CPU-Heavy Application: Using Node.js Is Simply a Bad Idea
* A Simple CRUD (or HTML) Application
* A Relational Database-Backed Server-Side App

# __In Other Way__

* Node.js hasn't been built with the “solving the compute scaling” issue in mind
* ...but it has been created to solve the I/O scaling issue instead
* excepting contexts of CPU-heavy operations
* ...Node.js still is the best technology at hand for powering your real-time, scalable web apps with
* Do reconsider your decision of using Node.js if for developing your piece of software you depend on some kind of threading model.
* there are also poor quality packages available in npm, free to use in your Node.js application; do keep this in mind as you dig deep into the “load” of  Node.js packages.
* Node.js will never be “the best choice” for event loop-blocking use cases (take asynchronous parsing XML, for instance).
* … nor for powering apps relying on intense computation
* Node'js “worker” is geared at solving HTTP server calling issues (rather than intense computing issues)


# __Always try to download Nodejs LTS(Logn term support) version because this is stable version.__

# __IDE/Editor for Nodejs is VSCode(Visiol studio code) simple lite weight and best.__

# __Nodejs Prerequisites

* Basic javaScript(Advanced JS will be bonus )
* ES5 &ES6|ECMAScript 6
* Client Server Model(optional)
*
